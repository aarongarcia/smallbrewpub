				%p.blurb.gray We have a 5bbl brewery that was built from the ground up out of repourposed dairy tanks by Aaron and Primo, (the brewers). Our approach is a little more old fashioned than most, it's very manual and hands-on but that's how we prefer it. Our recipe book is large and taps are always changing. We're not afraid to use wild yeast and bacteria when it suits us and our barrel program is always fun and exciting.

Fermented it as a traditional altbier and added a touch of salt to make a dry savory brew that will help you feel like a fasting monk. We release this beer every year on Ash Wedesday.
